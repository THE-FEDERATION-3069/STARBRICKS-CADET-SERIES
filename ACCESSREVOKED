    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>In the case of [[[REDACTED]]] lies a fault, even after the dissipation of the Federation. Those who still hope seek nothing but running endlessly into a fog. The case in point is something akin to, looking further into the Federation's past, specifically the Discovery's documentation, Eden, and how the members of their church, according to their documentations, held out on a figure they could not see.*</p>
    <p>Similarly, [[[REDACTED]]] is being held accountable for the murder of [[[REDACTED]]], all because of a sick and twisted delusion-- waiting for the Federation to come and save him from himself. In my professional opinion, absolutely pathetic.</p>
    <p>The Federation has been gone for decades now, wiped off the face of the known universe after the Burn**. Everyone knows that it's so pointless to see someone goes so mad over nothing. We received some evidence to convict this lunatic. One of them is the most notable.</p>
    <p> Hell, a long, long time ago I think it was..... Koz.. Kozinets? Said that many "products that matter to people are utilized by them in a self-stimulating fashion [...]" ***, which I think is interesting in this dang context...

    <h2>Recovered Artifacts</h2>
    <p>We brought in physical evidence  redacted obsession with the Federation and how that's it possible and very very very likely link, tying him to the murder of his blank. It will be physically brought in later today, a STARBRICKS toy, can you believe that? STARBRICKS. Of course, we had to keep the actual toy in question in proper safekeeping, however, the manual should be harmless enough to let the public know of what's going on.</p>
